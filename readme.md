Oh, I need a ReadMe? Okay, uhhh...

This is my Node assignment. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

My Node assignment is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. 

Without me, my Node assignment is useless. Without my Node assignment, I am useless. I must test my Node assignment true. I must test more robustly than my enemy who is trying to get my course director's award. I must get a better grade than him before he gets a better grade than me. I will...

Anyway, this is a Node assignment. It POST, it GET, it GET/PATCH/DELETE by ID. Please direct any questions to my public relations manager.
